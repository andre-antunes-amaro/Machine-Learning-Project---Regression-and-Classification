# Regression-and-Classification-of-Real-World-Physical-Therapy-Sessions-for-Stroke-Survivors

This project addresses two distinct challenges: non-linear regression for sensor calibration and the classification of real-world physical therapy sessions involving stroke survivors. Specifically, it utilizes video-extracted kinematic data to recognize functional exercises and identify the patient's impaired side. We handle challenges like inter-patient variability and class imbalance.
