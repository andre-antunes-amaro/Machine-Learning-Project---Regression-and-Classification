# Machine-Learning-Project---Regression-and-Classification

This was my Machine Learning course project (Master's level). It addresses two distinct challenges: non-linear regression for sensor calibration and the classification of real-world physical therapy sessions involving stroke survivors. Specifically, it utilizes video-extracted kinematic data to recognize functional exercises and identify the patient's impaired side. We handle challenges like inter-patient variability and class imbalance.
